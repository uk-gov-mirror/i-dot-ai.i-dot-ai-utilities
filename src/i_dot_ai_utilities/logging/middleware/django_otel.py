"""Django ``StructuredLoggingMiddlewareOTel``: the library's Django middleware.

Delegates HTTP-context extraction to OpenTelemetry's Django
auto-instrumentation: ``DjangoInstrumentor`` creates a server span per
request whose attributes carry ``http.request.method``, ``url.path``,
``http.route``, ``http.response.status_code`` etc.

The middleware keeps only the *log-lifecycle* concerns that cannot live
on a span:

- ``request_started`` / ``request_completed`` / ``request_failed`` events.
- ``duration_ms`` timing.
- Status-driven log-level selection (2xx→info, 4xx→warning, 5xx→error).
- ``request_id`` per-hop correlation (always a fresh UUID4 hex;
  verbatim inbound ``X-Request-ID`` is preserved separately as
  ``upstream_request_id`` when present and charset-valid).
- Exclusions (prefixes + regexes): log-pipeline concern, not span concern.
- Header allowlist capture: log-pipeline concern, not span concern.
- ``exception.type`` / ``error.type`` on failures.
- ``Http404`` carve-out (WARNING + synthetic 404, never ERROR).
- Scope-ownership guard around ``refresh_context`` so a view calling
  ``logger.refresh_context()`` cannot silently de-correlate its own
  audit trail mid-request.

Trace correlation on log records comes from the
:func:`otel_trace_context_processor` structlog processor reading the
active span on every event, **not** from the middleware. Consumers MUST
call :func:`configure_otel_for_django` (or wire the processor into their
own structlog chain) for ``trace_id`` / ``span_id`` / ``trace_flags`` to
appear on log lines. The middleware emits a loud one-shot WARNING at
startup when it detects that no SDK ``TracerProvider`` has been
installed, so forgetting the setup step is visible immediately rather
than showing up as a silent absence of trace correlation.

``user.id`` is **not** extracted by this middleware. Consumers who need
authenticated-user attribution on log records should add
:class:`i_dot_ai_utilities.logging.middleware.django_user_id.DjangoUserIdMiddleware`
to ``settings.MIDDLEWARE`` after ``AuthenticationMiddleware`` and this
middleware. That middleware preserves the hardening (no DB query on
unhydrated ``SimpleLazyObject``, database-error WARNINGs) without
reintroducing HTTP-context extraction.

Sync-only, thread-safe under Gunicorn sync / gthread workers via
``structlog.contextvars``.
